//FROM now and on we will be dealing with great topics...

//Database : oracle, mysql....

//we can use the sequelize orm to avoid writing raw sql queries.
//this will allow us to have a much more cleaner code as well as more clarity.


//To install mysql2 :
//===> npm i mysql2

//To install sequelize :
//===> npm i sequelize sequelize-cli

//To init sequelize :
//===> sequelize init //this will create a bunch of folders and files


//please look at the index.js in the root path.
